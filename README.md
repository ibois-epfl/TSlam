    <i><small>Augmented interface for woodworking powered by the TSlam's navigation system for subtractive fabrication. After the object is mapped, you can move it, cut it, or drill it and the camera will still be able to self-localize. </small></i>
</p>

ðŸªµðŸŒ² `TSlam` is developed at the [**Laboratory for Timber Construction**](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/ibois/) (director: Prof.Yves Weinand), at [**EPFL**](https://www.epfl.ch/en/), Lausanne, Switzerland. The project is part of the [**Augmented Carpentry Research**](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/ibois/augmented-carpentry/).

ðŸªšðŸ”¨ `TSlam` is an open-source **object-centered**, tag-based visual **navigation software for monocular RGB cameras** specifically developed in C++ and for UNIX systems to support a robust and accurate augmented reality pipeline for close-range, noisy, and cluttered fabrication sequences involving **wood-working operations** such as cutting, drilling, sawing and screwing with multiple tools and end-effectors.

ðŸ–§ `TSlam` leverages and combines multiple open-source projects ([UcoSLAM](http://www.uco.es/investiga/grupos/ava/node/62), [STag](https://github.com/bbenligiray/stag), [CGAL](https://www.cgal.org/)) to obtain a functional pipeline that can map, 3D reconstruct, and finally provide a robust camera pose stream at fabrication time to overlay an execution model with its digital twin model.

ðŸ”– `TSlam` was under development and testing for more than a year. For more details about the development go in the [Dev Log](./dev_log)

â†³ `TSlam` can be imported as a C++ API in your project or used as an executable.

## Benchmark

To benchmark the proposed navigation system under real fabrication scenarios, we produced a dataset of 1344 close-up different woodworking operations with multiple tools, tool heads, and varying parameters such as tags' layout and area density. The evaluation campaign indicates that TSlam is satisfyingly capable of detecting the camera's millimetric position and sub-angular rotation during the fabrication sequences to the exception of the saber saw. The dataset can be found [here](https://zenodo.org/record/8377793).

## Tag stickers

  <i><small>Example of a stripe as sticker employed in TSlam. Each stripe contains 50 fiducial markers of 20mm width.</small></i>
</p>

There are two ways you can consume the tags:
- `ready to print`: 450 stripes for a total of 21149 tags are available in batches of 50 stripes with an A0 format. They are ready to print (better as stickers) and can be downloaded [here](https://zenodo.org/record/7738721/files/stag_stickers_ready.zip?download=1).
- `generate your custom stripes`: if you need a specific tags layout you can run the python script from the terminal (from UNIX):
  `calibration_webcam.yml -voc ../../orb.fbow -out test`

## Build
```bash
# install library (compile from source opencv 4.5.5)
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install cmake qtbase5-dev libqt5opengl5-dev libopenni2-dev
git clone https://github.com/ibois-epfl/TSlam.git
cd TSlam

mkdir build && cd build
cmake ../ -DBUILD_4_API=OFF  # (ON: if building as API with no GUI)
make -j$(nproc)

sudo make install  # if building as API
```

## Run monocular slam as executable:
In this project, we provide you an example executable to run the monocular slam.
After building, an executable `tslam_monocular` will be generated in `build/utils`. You can run it with the following commend. Note that two extra parameters are needed: **video source** and path to the **camera calibration file**. 

In the `example` folder, we provide you an example video, a camera calibration file, and a map for you to test.

You first need to stick the tags your timber piece, do the mapping and later use the output map and reconstructed model to run the tracking.

``` bash
cd build/util

# ./tslam_monocular [{path_to_video}|live:{camera_index}] {camera_calibration_file}]
./tslam_monocular live:0 camera_calibration.yml
```
Here are some optional parameters: 
- `-voc`: Path to the vocabulary file for the feature describer. If an input map is specified, this is not needed;
otherwise, you won't be able to run mapping. In the `assets/voc` folder we provide `orb.fbow` for you to use.
- `-out`: Path to the output map.
- `-map`: Path to the input map.
- `-exportVideo`: Path and filename (without extension) to the output video. A video `[file/path/and/name].mp4` will be exported, containing the processed frames with SLAM information.
- `-exportRawVideo`:  Path and filename (without extension) to the output RAW video. A video `[file/path/and/name]_raw.mp4` will be exported, containing the original frames captured by the camera (exclude any processing).
- `-localizeOnly`: Indicating it's not mapping, so we can skip some operations.
- `-outCamPose`: Path to the output of the camera pose. The file will be a txt file with record in following format: `frame_id timestamp_in_sec(e.g. 1.232934542394) pos_x pos_y pos_z rot_quaternion_x rot_quaternion_y rot_quaternion_z rot_quaternion_w valid_marker_num` (separate by space). For untracked frames, the pose will be set to 0 and rotation quaternion will be `(x = 0, y = 0, z = 0, w = 1)`.
- `-drawMesh`: Path to the mesh to draw (in `.ply`) The mesh should be generated by the same input map.
- `-enableLoopClosure`: Enable optimization when loop closure is detected. You may notice dramatic lag during mapping with this flag on.
- `-noUndistort`: Disable the image undistortion (the program undistort the image based on the distortion matrix in the camera calibration file by default). You should only set this flag when you are using a pre-processed video sequence.
- `-noMapOptimize`: Disable the global optimization when saving the map.
- `-noKeyPoints`: Disable key-point detection (advised at runtime without a mask for the tool).
- `-noX`: Disable the display of the GUI.
- `-noDraw`: Disable the SLAM information drawing on the video. Enable this option to speed up when you only need to get the trajectory.
- `-startFrameID` and `-endFrameID`: When the input video is not a live camera, startFrameID and endFrameID can be set to only process a part of the video. The frame ID starts from 0, and both parameters are inclusive (i.e. [startFrameID, endFrameID]). The endFrameID can be blank if you want to process the video to the end.

When the window pop-out, you can press `s` to start/stop SLAM and `f` to enable the camera tracking in the virtual map, `q` to close and save the output data.

### Util Programs
Some utility programs will be built by default in `build/utils`

#### Map Optimizer
```bash
./tslam_map_optimizer input.map output.map
```
#### Map viewer
```bash
./tslam_map_viewer input.map
```
#### Combine Maps
```bash
./tslam_combine_map A.map B.map AB_comb.map
```
#### Export Maps
```bash
./tslam_map_export input.map output.[pcd|ply|yml]
```
#### Reconstruct model
```bash
./tslam_reconstruct "src/reconstruction/tests/test_data/real_scans/long_cut.yml" "./" "test_mesh_name"
```
This runs `tslam_reconstruct.cc`.
- `<path_to_map_yml>`: the path pointing to the `.yml` file of the map
- `<output_dir>`: the output dir for the reconstructed mesh
- `<mesh_name>`: the name of the `.ply` file
It's possible to input the parameters for the geometric solver. To see them, run `./tslam_reconstruct -h`

### Class `TSLAMReconstructor`
This is the class responsible for reconstructing the mesh model of the timber piece from the `.yml` file produced by the class `Map`.
If you want to test new features or make modifications to the reconstruction API you can compile the sub-program as a console app with a visual debugger powered by Open3d.
```bash
cd TSlam/src/reconstruction

cmake -S . -B build -DENABLE_O3D_VISUAL_DEBUG=ON -DENABLE_TESTING=ON
cmake --build build
```
You can go in the unit test series in `TSlam/src/reconstruction/tests/test_gsolver.cc` to see all the tests for different reconstruction of shapes.

```cpp
// load map for construction
